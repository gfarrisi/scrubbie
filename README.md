Description
Scrubbie is an advanced analytical tool geared towards providing intricate insights into the crypto wallet domain. Whether by searching using an address or uploading a list of wallets, users obtain vital data including wallet age, purchasing tendencies, and the count of NFTs bought. Additionally, Scrubbie delves into the specifics of NFTs obtained and identifies associated social profiles such as ENS, Lens, and Farcaster.

Scrubbie's capabilities go beyond as it lets users set their own criteria weights. This defines individual interpretations of high and low signal wallets. Consequently, the tool generates a score ranging from 0 to 100. This score signifies the likelihood that a wallet or a set of wallets are high or low signal, presenting a tailored, comprehensive perspective of the intricate crypto realm. Scrubbie stands out as an indispensable tool for those aiming to decode the intricacies of crypto wallet activities with precision.

## How It Works - Behind the Scenes
